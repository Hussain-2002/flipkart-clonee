# Architecture Overview

## 1. Overview

ShopEase is a modern e-commerce platform built using a React frontend and Express.js backend. The application follows a client-server architecture with clear separation of concerns. The system is designed to provide a responsive and feature-rich shopping experience with product browsing, cart management, wishlist functionality, and user authentication.

## 2. System Architecture

The application follows a typical web application architecture with the following main components:

```
┌─────────────┐      ┌─────────────┐      ┌─────────────┐
│             │      │             │      │             │
│   Client    │◄────►│   Server    │◄────►│  Database   │
│  (React)    │      │  (Express)  │      │ (PostgreSQL)│
│             │      │             │      │             │
└─────────────┘      └─────────────┘      └─────────────┘
```

### Client (Frontend)
- Built with React using a component-based architecture
- State management using Redux Toolkit
- UI components using Shadcn/UI (built on Radix UI primitives)
- API requests handled with TanStack Query
- Routing using Wouter (lightweight alternative to React Router)

### Server (Backend)
- Express.js server handling HTTP requests
- RESTful API endpoints for client communication
- Authentication system for user management
- Middleware for request logging and error handling

### Database
- PostgreSQL database (via Neon Database serverless)
- Drizzle ORM for database interactions and schema management
- Schema defined for users, products, categories, and cart items

## 3. Key Components

### 3.1 Frontend Components

#### Core Structure
- `/client/src/App.tsx`: Main application component with routing setup
- `/client/src/pages/`: Page components for different routes
- `/client/src/components/`: Reusable UI components
- `/client/src/lib/`: Utility functions, constants, and shared logic

#### State Management
- Redux store with multiple slices:
  - `cartSlice`: Manages shopping cart state
  - `wishlistSlice`: Manages wishlist items
  - `productSlice`: Manages product data and filtering

#### UI Components
- Shadcn UI components in `/client/src/components/ui/`
- Custom components for specific business logic

### 3.2 Backend Components

#### API Routes
- Defined in `/server/routes.ts`
- RESTful endpoints for resource management
- Authentication routes for user registration and login

#### Database Access
- Storage interface in `/server/storage.ts`
- In-memory implementation for development
- Production implementation using Drizzle ORM

#### Middleware
- Request logging
- Error handling
- Static file serving via Vite in development

### 3.3 Database Schema

The database schema is defined in `/shared/schema.ts` and includes the following tables:

- `users`: User account information
- `products`: Product catalog information
- `categories`: Product category information
- `cart`: User shopping cart items

## 4. Data Flow

### 4.1 Frontend to Backend Communication

1. The React frontend makes HTTP requests to the Express backend API
2. Requests are handled by API endpoint handlers in the server routes
3. The server performs necessary operations (database queries, etc.)
4. The server responds with JSON data
5. The frontend updates its state using Redux or React Query

### 4.2 Authentication Flow

1. User submits registration/login form
2. Frontend sends credentials to authentication endpoints
3. Backend validates credentials and creates/verifies user account
4. On successful authentication, user session is established
5. Authenticated requests include session information

### 4.3 Shopping Flow

1. Products are loaded into the Redux store
2. User browses and adds products to cart
3. Cart state is managed in Redux
4. Checkout process handles cart items and creates orders

## 5. External Dependencies

### 5.1 Frontend Dependencies
- **React**: UI library
- **Redux Toolkit**: State management
- **TanStack Query**: Data fetching and caching
- **Radix UI**: UI primitives for accessible components
- **Shadcn UI**: Component library built on Radix UI
- **Tailwind CSS**: Utility-first CSS framework
- **Wouter**: Lightweight routing library

### 5.2 Backend Dependencies
- **Express**: Web server framework
- **Drizzle ORM**: Type-safe ORM for database access
- **Zod**: Schema validation library
- **Neon Database**: Serverless PostgreSQL provider

## 6. Deployment Strategy

The application is configured for deployment on multiple platforms:

### 6.1 Development Environment
- Vite for local development with hot module replacement
- In-memory database for quick iteration
- Environment variables for configuration

### 6.2 Production Deployment
- Configured for deployment on Replit (via `.replit` configuration)
- Cloud Run deployment target specified
- Build process:
  1. Vite builds the frontend assets
  2. esbuild bundles the server code
  3. Combined assets are served by the production server

### 6.3 Database Strategy
- Development: In-memory storage implementation
- Production: PostgreSQL via Neon Database serverless
- Database URL configured via environment variables

## 7. Security Considerations

- Password hashing required in production (noted in code comments)
- API request logging with sensitive data redaction
- Input validation using Zod schemas
- Authentication mechanism included but needs proper session management in production

## 8. Future Architectural Considerations

- Implementing proper user authentication with JWT or session-based auth
- Adding payment gateway integration
- Implementing image upload and management
- Setting up proper error tracking and monitoring
- Adding performance optimizations for larger product catalogs
